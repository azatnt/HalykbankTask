# I created python project with name Task1,
# and created virtual environment to my project with name task1
# After this we can install any packages by
# using command "pip3 install <Name of package>"

# to check which packages installed
# we will use command <pip list>

# if we use terminal to activate virtual environment
# we use command <source name_of_env/bin/activate>
# I learned about virtual environment, when I created projects
# in Django, also when I set up settings of Linux OS in hosting
